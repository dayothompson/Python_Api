# 1.	Strong Correlation
It can be seen from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere scatter plots of the City Latitude vs Maximum Temperature that there is a strong correlation of absolute value 0.73 and 0.79 for both plots. Hence, the closer you are to the equator, the higher the temperature.

# 2.	City Locations
From the City Latitude vs. Humidity and City Latitude vs Wind Speed scatter plots, it can be inferred that there are more humid and windy cities located in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere.

# 3.	No Correlations
The scatter plot of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere showing the City Latitude vs. Wind Speed reveals that there’s no correlation between the locations of the cities and the speed of the wind.
